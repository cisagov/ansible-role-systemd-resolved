# The location of the file to which /etc/resolv.conf will be
# symlinked.  The symlink target should normally be one of the
# following files provided by systemd-resolved:
# 1. "{{ dynamic_resolv_conf_target_dir }}/stub-resolv.conf"
# 2. "{{ dynamic_resolv_conf_target_dir }}/resolv.conf"
# 3. "{{ static_resolv_conf_target_dir }}/resolv.conf"
#
# Note that the values of dynamic_resolv_conf_target_dir and
# static_resolv_conf_target_dir come from the role vars.
#
# In most cases you will want to use option 1 when using the
# systemd-resolved stub DNS resolver (127.0.0.53) and option 2 when
# using the DNS resolver provided via DHCP.  See here for more
